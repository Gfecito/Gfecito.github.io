<span class="expand_text">Hi! My name is Santiago and I was born and raised in <span style="color: crimson; font-size: 1.25em">Mexico</span></span>, 
my mother got my sister and I the privilege of going to fancy schools and learning english. 
I then got the chance of going on to learn french at another - even fancier - place, 
and getting several scholarships to study what I love most in the lovely maple land of Canada. <br><br>
I'm trying to become reliable and competent, to be able to give back to the people that have pushed
me forward.

const p1 = `
<span class="expand_text">I'm currently</span> a second year student and teacher assistant at the 
University of Montreal, in the Department of Computer Science and Operational Research (DIRO). 
It's been a bit odd to start my studies during the pandemic, but the unique challenges that came
with that have taught me things I wouldn't have expected.
`;
const p2 = `
<span class="expand_text">I love</span> playing the electric guitar; reading - especially topics outside 
of my field; I have some weird obsession with water and all its sports, 
specially those I'm terrible at. Like rowing with the UdeM's team, it's pretty fun to scream
synchronously with a bunch of charismatic strangers while desperately trying not to tip over.<br>
Also winning - winning is fun and a good excuse to scream some more.
`;
const p3 = `
<span class="expand_text">I really like teaching</span> and communicating science; 
I've met all kinds of people throughout my life and our different tastes, 
talents, experience, backgrounds, handicaps and challenges have taught me 
more than I could ever repay. I feel like by teaching, I pay just a bit of that debt.
